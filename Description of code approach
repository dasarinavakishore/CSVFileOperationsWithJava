4 classes created for different operations:
                                          CSVFileReaderAndOperations.java
                                          CSVFilesWriter.java
                                          MainClass.java
                                          CommonUtil.java

In the MainClass:

### Reading csv files & filtered duplicate records
  Step 1: 
       * Reading two input files(faceboo.csv & facebook-2.csv) using Bufferedreader class
       * While reading the files itsef added only unique records into the List and filtered duplicate records
       * While storing into the List checked below things:
                                                     --> removed the row which starts or contains with 'String'
                                                     --> replaced # with empty which starts with '#' as first char
                                                     --> replaced end ;; with 0; to avoid empty/null at the end of every line or row
       * printed duplicate records in the console and unique records merged into the final list.
       
  Step 2:
       * After getting merged final list then writing that list into "temp.csv" file with comma(,) seperated values
       
### Reading merged csv file & calculate averages
  Step 1:
       * While reading temp.csv file itself sorted records in alphabetical order and stored into set and 1st row(header) into headers array
  Step 2:
       * Iterating set and calculated averages based on starting alphabet of the country which starts with alphabet 'a' or 'A' and stored into the final list
       * After getting the final ist then writing that list into "output.csv" file with comma(,) seperated values
       * output.csv file contains averages of every columns which country starts with 'A'
